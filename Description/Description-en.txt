For my new project, I'm briefly testing the ViewSonic M2W LED projector today.

With 1,700 LED lumens, the latest model is the brightest of the three M2 colleagues:

- M2: 1200 LED lumens
- M2e: 1000 LED lumens 
- M2W: 1700 LED lumens

Jump Marks:

00:01 Unboxing Beamer
06:01 Switch on
07:20 Setting up orientation
09:28 Setting up WLAN
13:58 Mirroring the screen with Air Play (trial)
17:07 Connecting USB-C
19:25 Play movie test
20:50 Setting up picture format
21:20 Picture jerks, frames are lost

Recording Setup:

A Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra would be used for the video and audio would *not* be edited afterwards.

Suggestions for improvement:

- 08:44 Progress bar on horizontal/vertical position setting.

Music used:

- Success Of The Whole Team (WinnieTheMoog).
