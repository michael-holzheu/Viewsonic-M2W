1
00:00:01,499 --> 00:00:07,664
So here we have “ViewSonic” smart LED projector

2
00:00:08,664 --> 00:00:13,196
with “Harman Kardon” sound on board.

3
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:27,525
And here we have the...
M2W!

4
00:00:28,125 --> 00:00:33,357
This is one of the three
types...

5
00:00:33,357 --> 00:00:35,756
of this projector that you
can buy.

6
00:00:35,756 --> 00:00:44,820
And the one with the highest light intensity:
1700 lumens!

7
00:00:45,986 --> 00:00:47,386
And...

8
00:00:47,386 --> 00:00:50,818
Yes, now let's see what the
device can do.

9
00:00:50,818 --> 00:00:51,972
Or rather, before we find out,

10
00:00:51,972 --> 00:00:55,645
maybe we should just unpack it!

11
00:00:56,417 --> 00:01:09,380
(Sounds: Opening the package, coughing)

12
00:01:10,846 --> 00:01:16,911
That's positive:
The device is quite compact.

13
00:01:16,911 --> 00:01:21,710
Just as described in the
test reports...

14
00:01:22,509 --> 00:01:32,373
A lot of connection options:
USB-C, HDMI, USB-A

15
00:01:32,373 --> 00:01:40,471
the normal and just the normal
mains plug, micro-SD slot,

16
00:01:41,071 --> 00:01:45,836
audio-out jack plug and an
on/off switch.

17
00:01:46,803 --> 00:01:52,534
Probably fans or that could of course also be speakers,
I don't know exactly.

18
00:01:53,334 --> 00:02:00,399
Fan again. The lens in front. LED lens with a
very long lifespan...

19
00:02:00,965 --> 00:02:02,631
And here some sensors.

20
00:02:04,997 --> 00:02:10,663
And below “Risk Group 2”, whatever
that means.

21
00:02:11,862 --> 00:02:19,760
Then we have here...
To set up...

22
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,126
We still need electricity!

23
00:02:28,957 --> 00:02:32,290
A bag, very practical! We definitely
need it!

24
00:02:44,086 --> 00:02:46,919
Bright images anywhere
you go.

25
00:02:49,452 --> 00:02:52,184
Here's the power supply unit...

26
00:02:53,984 --> 00:03:01,215
And then the two cables, one for our English colleagues
or America, I don't know exactly.

27
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:12,412
And then the typical two-pin plug that...
Well, what's it called here?

28
00:03:12,945 --> 00:03:18,443
So not the Europlug, but the other one.
Forgot his name!

29
00:03:18,443 --> 00:03:24,808
Then we have a remote control
and batteries.

30
00:03:26,722 --> 00:03:33,939
There is one more thing I forgot, and that
is a USB-C cable.

31
00:03:42,736 --> 00:03:57,666
So step... Step two: First fill the remote
control with electricity.

32
00:03:57,999 --> 00:04:00,398
A Challenge for the...

33
00:04:00,398 --> 00:04:02,831
How do you get it open
without tools?

34
00:04:04,597 --> 00:04:05,397
Not at all?

35
00:04:05,397 --> 00:04:05,997
After all!

36
00:04:07,896 --> 00:04:20,026
(Sounds: Unpack and insert batteries)

37
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:23,558
Come on!

38
00:04:23,558 --> 00:04:27,957
How does it work? Just close it!
So...

39
00:04:27,957 --> 00:04:31,891
And then this will probably
work!

40
00:04:31,891 --> 00:04:34,392
Then we need electricity, because
this one...

41
00:04:34,392 --> 00:04:38,687
We'll put it back right away.

42
00:04:49,884 --> 00:04:53,816
Looks to me too, a bit like I'm
not the first to

43
00:04:53,816 --> 00:04:58,524
unpack this device. But that's the
way it is...

44
00:05:01,647 --> 00:05:18,243
(Sounds: Rustling, honking, coughing)

45
00:05:19,509 --> 00:05:23,763
IEC connector, or whatever it's called.
Tripole again.

46
00:05:25,974 --> 00:05:29,839
Then we need the electricity, can you see
that here?

47
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:33,572
Exactly, the electricity in here!

48
00:05:33,572 --> 00:05:37,637
So there we have it!

49
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:45,502
Then next... extension cord!
Have we here already...

50
00:05:45,968 --> 00:05:53,966
(Sounds: Cable reel)

51
00:05:54,399 --> 00:06:01,216
Cable! Power, power is on.

52
00:06:01,797 --> 00:06:05,429
In theory, I think you could turn
it on now.

53
00:06:05,663 --> 00:06:07,362
Does it work?

54
00:06:07,462 --> 00:06:09,162
No, what's up?

55
00:06:09,162 --> 00:06:10,561
Oh yes, it starts up!

56
00:06:10,561 --> 00:06:13,261
(Sounds: Fan starts up)

57
00:06:13,261 --> 00:06:15,193
And you can already hear the fan!

58
00:06:15,193 --> 00:06:16,267
Wow, and...

59
00:06:16,267 --> 00:06:19,892
(Sounds: music from Harman Kardon speakers)

60
00:06:19,892 --> 00:06:21,625
Tone sounds promising!

61
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:25,157
(Sound: Fan starting)

62
00:06:25,157 --> 00:06:32,368
And now let's do it somehow...

63
00:06:33,622 --> 00:06:38,580
Yes, it's very loud!

64
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:41,386
Oh my...

65
00:06:41,386 --> 00:06:43,219
I was kinda hoping it wasn't that loud!

66
00:06:43,219 --> 00:06:50,483
(Sound: Fan start->Full screen)

67
00:06:50,483 --> 00:06:52,961
And he already has...

68
00:06:54,127 --> 00:06:55,690
the picture on the wall.

69
00:06:55,690 --> 00:07:02,080
You can't see that here, wait a minute!

70
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,213
He doesn't have zoom.

71
00:07:03,213 --> 00:07:06,579
That means we have to do it somehow...

72
00:07:06,812 --> 00:07:10,747
Now we need to adjust the distance so
that it fits.

73
00:07:11,911 --> 00:07:15,709
Hm, okay...

74
00:07:15,709 --> 00:07:18,909
We'll have to do that somehow...

75
00:07:19,042 --> 00:07:22,874
But I've also heard that it has a
trapeze function

76
00:07:23,107 --> 00:07:27,173
that sets it up automatically,
so to speak.

77
00:07:27,673 --> 00:07:29,606
How does it work?

78
00:07:29,606 --> 00:07:32,423
Ah, there we have different options:

79
00:07:32,423 --> 00:07:33,534
Ceiling...

80
00:07:33,804 --> 00:07:36,237
Then we can do it somehow, oops...

81
00:07:36,437 --> 00:07:41,353
Now I do left right: It's kind of mirrored there.

82
00:07:43,768 --> 00:07:47,767
I wanted, actually thought, that this here...

83
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:49,767
(Sound: Remote control buttons)

84
00:07:49,767 --> 00:07:51,199
What is he doing there?

85
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:52,620
Now he always does...

86
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:55,965
flip vertically, right?

87
00:07:55,965 --> 00:07:58,156
Or horizontally?

88
00:08:00,197 --> 00:08:01,896
What's happening?

89
00:08:02,263 --> 00:08:04,162
Oh now!

90
00:08:04,362 --> 00:08:06,895
Then he flips it because...

91
00:08:06,895 --> 00:08:09,761
It's totally confusing...

92
00:08:09,761 --> 00:08:42,518
(Sounds: Fast forward)

93
00:08:42,518 --> 00:08:48,000
Why does it flip the picture now
when I press on it?

94
00:08:48,117 --> 00:08:49,050
But here “ViewSonic”...

95
00:08:49,316 --> 00:08:52,549
Now like this! Now ViewSonic, the...

96
00:08:52,549 --> 00:08:56,162
the writing is correct and now I should,
if I press “OK”, 

97
00:08:56,681 --> 00:08:59,447
it should be the right mode, right?

98
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:01,613
Let's just press "OK"...

99
00:09:02,346 --> 00:09:04,879
Now it is ok! I probably just made that
mistake earlier.

100
00:09:05,412 --> 00:09:07,911
So, we want German!

101
00:09:13,876 --> 00:09:16,109
What's happening now?
Skip...

102
00:09:16,975 --> 00:09:20,753
And there you can see... The writing,
for example, isn't pretty here, well...

103
00:09:21,241 --> 00:09:22,640
Let's connect with the "Muckel"..

104
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,806
We don't need that for now! Then
we do "skip".

105
00:09:24,806 --> 00:09:28,305
We just want to connect the laptop
for a moment.

106
00:09:28,305 --> 00:09:30,738
No, okay, so we'll connect to the "Muckel"
in a moment.

107
00:09:30,738 --> 00:09:35,603
So we enter Password...
Password.

108
00:09:42,635 --> 00:09:46,667
We have to stop here for a moment!

109
00:09:46,667 --> 00:09:51,839
So the stopping was probably unnecessary because
here you would have...

110
00:09:52,998 --> 00:09:54,831
What happened now?
OK.

111
00:09:54,831 --> 00:09:56,864
I wanted, I thought I could use this

112
00:09:56,864 --> 00:10:02,129
as a laser pointer like this, but obviously
it's not possible.

113
00:10:02,162 --> 00:10:04,328
Too bad, too bad, too bad. That would be it if
you could have used it for...

114
00:10:04,995 --> 00:10:07,194
If you could have used it as a
laser pointer.

115
00:10:07,194 --> 00:10:08,561
But it seems that...

116
00:10:08,561 --> 00:10:13,859
So I thought I'd push this
button here, and... 

117
00:10:13,992 --> 00:10:15,125
This one!

118
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,325
But it did not work.

119
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:20,424
Because you could now here...
Display the password “off”.

120
00:10:20,424 --> 00:10:23,023
Oh no, that would have
been useless!

121
00:10:23,323 --> 00:10:25,856
Understood! So go on!

122
00:10:26,622 --> 00:10:29,388
So, we want to “connect”!

123
00:10:31,321 --> 00:10:36,953
And now we get it "connected"...
"verified", "password error", oh!

124
00:10:37,452 --> 00:10:38,452
I get the crisis!

125
00:10:38,452 --> 00:10:40,818
So again!

126
00:10:40,818 --> 00:10:42,918
Um, password again, sorry!

127
00:10:43,451 --> 00:10:46,483
So, now I've verified, the password
*must* be correct!

128
00:10:46,483 --> 00:10:49,715
So let's try it again,
"Connect"...

129
00:10:51,315 --> 00:10:55,847
If it doesn't work now,
it's not me!

130
00:10:55,847 --> 00:10:58,713
Yes, I entered it wrong earlier,
all right!

131
00:11:00,046 --> 00:11:03,112
And now onto “next”,
right?

132
00:11:03,112 --> 00:11:09,677
So, now we have here...
The remote control:

133
00:11:09,677 --> 00:11:15,408
“USB-C”, “HDMI”, “USB”, “Local Storage”,
“Micro SD”.

134
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:18,208
“Apps” we have, “Bluetooth”...

135
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:21,373
What do we do next?

136
00:11:21,373 --> 00:11:23,173
So just connect a laptop, right?

137
00:11:23,173 --> 00:11:25,672
This is what you actually need
most often.

138
00:11:26,305 --> 00:11:29,104
This is... Where is now?
If I somehow

139
00:11:29,971 --> 00:11:33,103
move the remote control here now,nothing happens.

140
00:11:33,103 --> 00:11:35,062
Why?

141
00:11:36,202 --> 00:11:37,235
Why can't I do anything now...

142
00:11:37,235 --> 00:11:39,468
I probably have to press "OK" right?

143
00:11:39,468 --> 00:11:40,168
Oh!

144
00:11:40,968 --> 00:11:41,634
No?

145
00:11:42,111 --> 00:11:45,246
What happened now?

146
00:11:45,566 --> 00:11:48,099
Yes, yes, but “OK” it was!
So...

147
00:11:48,099 --> 00:11:50,832
That was just the remote control
quickly faded in.

148
00:11:50,832 --> 00:11:52,664
And if you press “OK”, you
get further.

149
00:11:52,664 --> 00:11:54,064
Alright...

150
00:11:54,264 --> 00:11:55,197
What do we have?

151
00:11:55,197 --> 00:11:58,063
So this fan is pretty
extremely loud!

152
00:11:59,196 --> 00:12:00,462
So really terribly loud.

153
00:12:00,462 --> 00:12:02,728
It's as loud as with my old...

154
00:12:02,728 --> 00:12:04,361
With my old projector.

155
00:12:04,361 --> 00:12:08,393
Maybe you can do that somehow...

156
00:12:09,593 --> 00:12:14,525
Turn down: “Projector”, “German”,
“Keystone”, “Zoo...”

157
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:15,858
Oh, there is a zoom after all!

158
00:12:15,858 --> 00:12:17,300
I would not have thought that!

159
00:12:17,957 --> 00:12:20,423
Ok, there is a zoom.

160
00:12:20,423 --> 00:12:22,523
I thought this has no zoom.

161
00:12:22,523 --> 00:12:24,355
Already good!

162
00:12:24,355 --> 00:12:28,454
Okay, only 0.8, but it looks
better from here.

163
00:12:29,787 --> 00:12:31,020
OK.

164
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:33,553
Oh and then there was this...

165
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:37,585
Auto Keystone Correction
(Auto V-Keystone Correction)...

166
00:12:37,985 --> 00:12:41,517
It was supposed to...

167
00:12:41,684 --> 00:12:43,683
“Table in front”...

168
00:12:44,017 --> 00:12:47,216
“Adjust 4 corners”...

169
00:12:48,049 --> 00:12:51,248
Okay, that's maybe now to advanced.

170
00:12:53,214 --> 00:12:54,014
“Basic settings”.

171
00:12:54,014 --> 00:12:56,013
What else is there to do?“
Advanced Settings”...

172
00:12:56,013 --> 00:12:57,746
Can we maybe just turn this
down a bit?

173
00:12:58,646 --> 00:13:01,812
“Energy”, “Sleep Timer”, no...

174
00:13:02,178 --> 00:13:09,309
“Volume”, “Mute”, “Full Screen”, “Light Source Level”...

175
00:13:09,909 --> 00:13:13,008
What can I set there? “Energy saving mode”...

176
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:16,007
“Energy saving mode” maybe it will be a
bit quieter then?

177
00:13:16,007 --> 00:13:18,473
Oh yes, it's getting quieter.

178
00:13:19,107 --> 00:13:20,273
Still too loud!

179
00:13:20,573 --> 00:13:24,938
(Sound: Fan energy-saving mode)

180
00:13:25,372 --> 00:13:27,638
So I imagined it to be
much quieter.

181
00:13:28,904 --> 00:13:29,970
And when I then go to
"full screen"...

182
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:34,436
Then it gets a lot louder.

183
00:13:36,035 --> 00:13:39,767
OK.
And don't cancel now, but “Projector”?

184
00:13:39,767 --> 00:13:41,434
No, we don't want to!

185
00:13:42,967 --> 00:13:44,933
We just want to click "OK"...

186
00:13:44,933 --> 00:13:47,432
Actually, you just have to get out of the menu.

187
00:13:47,432 --> 00:13:51,931
Probably because it will be configured immediately.

188
00:13:52,264 --> 00:13:54,430
OK. Out again!

189
00:13:55,463 --> 00:13:56,696
So good.

190
00:13:56,696 --> 00:13:58,362
“Hub” can be added.

191
00:13:58,362 --> 00:14:00,795
Screen mirroring is also available, interesting!

192
00:14:01,395 --> 00:14:02,794
Can you now here...

193
00:14:02,794 --> 00:14:03,694
“Make sure”...

194
00:14:03,694 --> 00:14:07,026
That works with Apple and with...

195
00:14:07,326 --> 00:14:11,825
Ahh, here it's obvious from Apple...

196
00:14:11,825 --> 00:14:15,791
What's that called at Apple?

197
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:19,123
The “Screen Mirroring”

198
00:14:20,456 --> 00:14:22,255
is called by Apple “AirPlay”.

199
00:14:22,255 --> 00:14:23,888
Right "AirPlay", I think so!

200
00:14:23,888 --> 00:14:27,387
Now let's put the thing somewhere on the box.

201
00:14:32,053 --> 00:14:34,452
Let's try AirPlay.

202
00:14:35,252 --> 00:14:38,418
Ha, way too loud, really!

203
00:14:38,418 --> 00:14:39,017
So...

204
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:46,948
On the... Put on the box here.

205
00:14:47,915 --> 00:14:57,545
(Sounds: Projector alone - “Full Screen” mode)

206
00:14:57,879 --> 00:15:03,577
So, let's try this now...
“Screen Sharing”.

207
00:15:04,377 --> 00:15:05,710
Where's my Apple (device)?

208
00:15:08,809 --> 00:15:11,408
So let's try it with the iPad first.

209
00:15:13,841 --> 00:15:16,507
Here is the iPad.

210
00:15:19,139 --> 00:15:23,705
How do we do it like this?
Yes...

211
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:30,769
We're doing here...

212
00:15:31,003 --> 00:15:33,635
Ah wait, the “Control Center” probably.

213
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:37,801
And what is he saying here? We should
(enter the) “Control Center”...

214
00:15:37,867 --> 00:15:41,966
And then there's “Screen Sharing” somewhere,
where was that?

215
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:47,198
Focus...

216
00:15:48,298 --> 00:15:50,797
It should be somewhere on the left.

217
00:15:51,597 --> 00:15:55,062
Ah, probably up here: “Playback”,
“iPad”, “ViewSonic”.

218
00:15:55,062 --> 00:16:00,128
He already shows it, which is of course cool.
Can you see it here?

219
00:16:00,128 --> 00:16:02,594
ViewSonic displayed...

220
00:16:02,994 --> 00:16:06,426
When I click on that, I now have the

221
00:16:06,426 --> 00:16:10,958
“ViewSonic”, “ViewSonic” over WiFi...
Okay.

222
00:16:11,091 --> 00:16:13,890
And why can't I see anything now?

223
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:17,323
Playback...

224
00:16:20,322 --> 00:16:22,288
Nothing works, why?

225
00:16:22,288 --> 00:16:24,587
Well, I'll probably have to...
Ah yes, now something is coming!

226
00:16:24,587 --> 00:16:26,587
Takes time! No?

227
00:16:30,153 --> 00:16:32,918
Why is it not working?

228
00:16:33,585 --> 00:16:39,350
He's playing "Fettes Brot" (German song) right now,
for whatever reason.

229
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:43,946
Um, okay, again on that...

230
00:16:47,448 --> 00:16:49,980
Three: "Connect", yes...

231
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:50,980
"ViewSonic" selected...

232
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:54,246
Maybe we have to press "OK" here too?

233
00:16:54,379 --> 00:16:56,945
No, screen...

234
00:16:56,945 --> 00:17:00,000
Like that! Now why doesn't it work?

235
00:17:00,175 --> 00:17:06,709
(Sounds: Fast-forward)

236
00:17:08,975 --> 00:17:14,773
We'll just try USB-C now.
For beginners...

237
00:17:17,806 --> 00:17:21,805
(Sounds: Fast-forward)

238
00:17:22,871 --> 00:17:25,670
So, let's put USB-C in here.

239
00:17:28,503 --> 00:17:29,436
Recognized!

240
00:17:29,436 --> 00:17:31,102
Do you want to change it?

241
00:17:31,102 --> 00:17:33,668
Yes we do!

242
00:17:33,668 --> 00:17:34,868
Good.

243
00:17:38,433 --> 00:17:41,299
No signal input...

244
00:17:42,099 --> 00:17:46,031
Hey, jei, jei... Why is that now?

245
00:17:46,031 --> 00:17:50,930
We have USB-C here now...
What's the problem?

246
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:53,662
Now we have to go to the screens
here probably...

247
00:17:54,295 --> 00:17:58,028
System settings...

248
00:18:04,459 --> 00:18:06,325
Save in any case!

249
00:18:07,258 --> 00:18:08,325
Also remove!

250
00:18:09,724 --> 00:18:14,523
Make smaller, make smaller.

251
00:18:14,823 --> 00:18:16,622
So screens:

252
00:18:17,622 --> 00:18:20,921
No signal input, why?

253
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,153
What screens do we have?

254
00:18:26,153 --> 00:18:29,034
Add display, ViewSonic.

255
00:18:30,252 --> 00:18:30,785
Yes...

256
00:18:31,818 --> 00:18:34,951
So that's possible here now.

257
00:18:35,217 --> 00:18:38,116
And then we want them next to each other, right?

258
00:18:40,882 --> 00:18:41,982
We want them...

259
00:18:41,982 --> 00:18:46,681
“Display”, “Settings screen”, “Main screen”

260
00:18:46,681 --> 00:18:49,813
is this...

261
00:18:52,646 --> 00:18:55,511
Main screen, but then...
We don't want...

262
00:18:55,511 --> 00:18:58,377
We want to have them next to
each other.

263
00:18:58,377 --> 00:19:04,209
Um, we don't want to mirror, we want to
stop syncing.

264
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:06,975
Ah yes, now we have it, ok!

265
00:19:06,975 --> 00:19:07,675
Finished.

266
00:19:07,675 --> 00:19:10,374
Now that we have the two side by side.

267
00:19:10,374 --> 00:19:12,773
And can slide this over here.

268
00:19:12,773 --> 00:19:15,239
OK. Play movie soon...

269
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:19,438
Maybe.

270
00:19:20,404 --> 00:19:23,603
What movie are we playing, anything

271
00:19:23,603 --> 00:19:26,203
cool!

272
00:19:27,002 --> 00:19:30,002
We take “Terminator Tennis” here.

273
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:33,934
It's always, always nice to look at!

274
00:19:34,567 --> 00:19:37,952
Hey Giovanni! Today you are due!

275
00:19:39,432 --> 00:19:40,299
See you soon!

276
00:19:43,631 --> 00:19:45,964
But that's actually...

277
00:19:45,964 --> 00:19:49,030
At least the sound is coming!

278
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:51,729
And now we should then...

279
00:19:52,429 --> 00:19:55,928
get it over here at some point...

280
00:20:00,793 --> 00:20:03,359
How do we get it over here now?

281
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:16,655
(Sounds: Film music)

282
00:20:17,855 --> 00:20:21,287
Now slide over here...
Oh no...

283
00:20:23,753 --> 00:20:26,086
And then here...

284
00:20:26,452 --> 00:20:28,452
Large...

285
00:20:32,051 --> 00:20:36,016
How are we going to make this large, folks?

286
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:41,915
"Play"...

287
00:20:41,915 --> 00:20:46,547
Well, that's obviously not 16:9 from the format...

288
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:49,912
But...

289
00:20:50,845 --> 00:20:55,877
It's kind of funny here.
Weird format!

290
00:20:56,644 --> 00:20:58,677
How can I make settings now?

291
00:20:58,677 --> 00:21:02,375
“Format Settings”...

292
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:07,441
“Color Mode”...

293
00:21:09,773 --> 00:21:14,605
“Aspect Ratio” 16:9...
Ah okay now.

294
00:21:14,605 --> 00:21:16,905
It doesn't fit either.

295
00:21:16,905 --> 00:21:17,838
Yes / Yes!

296
00:21:18,338 --> 00:21:19,904
Yes, come!

297
00:21:20,437 --> 00:21:23,403
So everything is not so great here.

298
00:21:23,736 --> 00:21:27,268
Here for example: Unbelievable, but true...

299
00:21:27,268 --> 00:21:30,468
So the mouse pointer is not synchronized here.

300
00:21:30,468 --> 00:21:31,601
He always gets stuck here.

301
00:21:31,767 --> 00:21:32,734
That must not be!

302
00:21:32,734 --> 00:21:38,265
USB-C, that actually has to be smooth and on the...

303
00:21:38,932 --> 00:21:42,264
monitor it moves smoothly...

304
00:21:43,997 --> 00:21:46,796
So the mouse pointer moves smoothly there.

305
00:21:48,229 --> 00:21:50,262
And here it is

306
00:21:50,462 --> 00:21:53,628
absolutely

307
00:21:53,794 --> 00:21:56,360
unacceptable for me, really unacceptable,

308
00:21:57,093 --> 00:22:01,159
so here it is jerky, it is jerky...

309
00:22:01,159 --> 00:22:03,725
Now the demonstration effect, of course!

310
00:22:03,725 --> 00:22:05,652
But yes, here he jerks.

311
00:22:06,857 --> 00:22:09,361
Always gets stuck somehow.

312
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,322
Yes, got stuck here again.

313
00:22:12,598 --> 00:22:13,955
Just stuck.

314
00:22:13,955 --> 00:22:16,554
So that's actually not useful for me...

315
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:19,792
Too loud...

316
00:22:19,792 --> 00:22:24,286
Relatively badly intuitive...

317
00:22:24,286 --> 00:22:27,785
Zoom okay...

318
00:22:27,785 --> 00:22:29,584
But that's...

319
00:22:29,584 --> 00:22:32,150
The absolute killer criterion:
Because of course I need

320
00:22:32,717 --> 00:22:33,716
proper synchronization.

321
00:22:33,716 --> 00:22:35,516
I'm wondering why is this again?

322
00:22:35,516 --> 00:22:39,148
Because when I play a film, it has to work.

323
00:22:39,148 --> 00:22:41,547
It can't be that...

324
00:22:43,447 --> 00:22:44,499
It can't be that

325
00:22:44,499 --> 00:22:46,734
the film is jerky here too, right?

326
00:22:50,478 --> 00:22:52,478
Yet it also jerks...

327
00:22:52,911 --> 00:22:53,811
And now we are at the...

328
00:22:53,811 --> 00:22:55,610
Oh, that's because of the screen...

329
00:22:55,943 --> 00:22:58,576
It's stuck again, unbelievable!

330
00:22:58,576 --> 00:22:59,742
Just hang here.

331
00:22:59,742 --> 00:23:02,808
That can now be up to Apple again, of course.

332
00:23:02,975 --> 00:23:03,541
But wait...

333
00:23:03,541 --> 00:23:06,040
I have a Mac right now...

334
00:23:07,107 --> 00:23:10,173
And I would actually like to continue using it
for the time being and

335
00:23:10,672 --> 00:23:14,371
that's why it's actually not acceptable so far,
we can't use it!

336
00:23:15,871 --> 00:23:17,337
Unfortunately, you have to send it back...

337
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:19,970
Well...

338
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:22,369
That's how it is then!

339
00:23:25,502 --> 00:23:27,434
So now it's packed up again

340
00:23:27,434 --> 00:23:29,867
and unfortunately has to be returned.

341
00:23:29,867 --> 00:23:31,367
Unfortunately I do...

342
00:23:31,367 --> 00:23:34,133
I really don't like doing it, but...

343
00:23:34,999 --> 00:23:37,132
If the mouse doesn't work...
